GRAPHQL LAB-1

Accessing private GraphQL posts

Scenerio: There is a webpage containing posts with id where one post is hidden (task: find the password of that post)connected by graphql endpoints.

Analysis:
- API Endpoint: /graphql/v1
- Hidden post id: 3
- getBlogPost --> allows is to get the post content 

Exploitation:
- Capture request of any other post to access "getBlogPost".
- Add a query "postPassword" and change the id variable to 3.
- Send the request --> In response we will get the password.
